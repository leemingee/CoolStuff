    In default, delta is 1 and there is no penalty term wst delta in objective function.

    Inputs have dimension D, there are C classes, and we operate on minibatches
    of N examples.

    Inputs:
    - W: a numpy array of shape (D, C) containing weights.
    - X: a numpy array of shape (N, D) containing N samples.
    - y: a numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = c means
         that X[i] has label c, where 0 <= c < C.
    - reg: (float) L2 regularization strength

    - loss: a float scalar
